The Meteor Blaze Tutorial is where you can start learning the basics of Meteor with Blaze.

Before you begin - If you want to know more about Meteor check our [website](https://www.meteor.com).

A few tips before you start:
- If you want to check the final code for each step, you can always go to the [`src`](https://github.com/meteor/blaze-tutorial/tree/master/src) folder.
- Each folder inside the [`src`](https://github.com/meteor/blaze-tutorial/tree/master/src) folder is a tutorial and a Meteor app which you can run at any time.
  - Install it: `meteor npm install`
  - Run it: `meteor`
- If you see `..` in the code samples, it means that we are not showing all the code on this file or function. 


The `Simple Todos` tutorial is the best place for you to start with Meteor and Blaze. Check it out [here](/simple-todos/).
